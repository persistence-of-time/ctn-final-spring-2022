        <div class="container">
            <p>Misinformation is shared in Spanish more easily on social networks than in other languages ​​for many reasons. For the past three months, we have joined an international fact-checking effort to combat disinformation shared in Spanish.</p>
    
            <p>In March, we <a href="https://medium.com/eldeadline/cual-es-la-diferencia-entre-misinformaci%C3%B3n-y-la-desinformaci%C3%B3n-37149643006f">explained</a> the difference between social media misinformation and disinformation, and how you can check whether your information is correct or false. We then share the stories of three Latinos, <a href="https://medium.com/eldeadline/peleando-contra-la-desinformaci%C3%B3n-de-la-vacuna-del-covid-19-ba028111683e">John Rodríguez</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/eldeadline/verificador-de-datos-combina-datos-y-el-alcance-comunitario-para-combatir-la-desinformaci%C3%B3n-fef193448334">Jaime Longoria Castillo</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/eldeadline/grace-battaglia-y-el-trabajo-que-nunca-se-imagino-75aed6b29b3c">Grace Battaglia</a>, who fight disinformation through their work.</p>
    
            <p>So how do you combat misinformation shared in Spanish when community trust is lacking, and how was this group able to combat this?
            </p>
            <h3>The problem</h3>
    
            <p>Latinos are at risk of being victims of misinformation for a variety of factors. Whether they are about health or politics, the elements that facilitate their distribution are the same. </p>

            <p>Professors Jeronimo Cortina and Brandon Rottinghaus <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/20531680221083535">analyzed</a> how political behaviors in the Latin American community directly correlate with the impact of disinformation. They hypothesized that Latinos, while generally having weak partisan ties, have strong ideological beliefs. They added that, "exposure to selected political messages that resonate with people's beliefs shapes the depths of belief in conspiracy theories." This is more common when a conspiracy coincides with the ideological preferences of the individual and there is a lack of political knowledge.</p>

            <p>A <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/37367224/austin_political_engagement_communities_of_color_20210308.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y">study</a> conducted by Harvard concluded that non-white respondents, which included Latin Americans, taught less knowledge about COVID-19 and less media literacy than their white counterparts. Despite this, non-white respondents accepted COVID-19 misinformation at a higher rate. The study found an association between media literacy skills and knowledge of COVID-19, concluding that media literacy is essential for informing people of color with accurate information.</p>

            <p>Cortina and Rottinghaus also said that Latinos who relied on social media as their primary source of information rather than traditional media were more likely to believe conspiracy theories. Social media is a key driver of disinformation because it increases party loyalty to the truth. In 2019, <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/whatsapp-beats-out-instagram-and-twitter-among-us-hispanic-users">52%</a> of Latinos in the United States use Whatsapp. Cortina and Rottinghaus found that reports from the 2020 elections found that disinformation spread through Whatsapp, Telegram and Facebook raised fears of communism among other shared political fears in the Latin American community in the United States. People who rely on social media for news are more likely to believe and latch onto the misinformation spread on the platforms they use.</p>

            <p>To provide Latin Americans with accurate information, access to fact-checking is critical. Latin American countries and Spain, according to journalists Victoria Moreno-Gil, Xavier Ramon and Ruth Rodríguez-Martínez, "share great challenges such as limited journalistic autonomy, difficulties in accessing public data, [and] the politicization of the media." This puts Latin Americans and Spaniards at risk of being victims of disinformation in the United States since they come with these customs from their countries of origin.</p>

            <p>Through their research, Moreno-Gil, Ramón, and Rodríguez-Martínez analyzed a variety of small fact-checking organizations working in Latin America, including Chequeado in Argentina and Maldita.es in Spain.</p>
        

             <h3>At the forefront</h3>
            <p>All organizations evaluated identified three challenges in fact-checking: a difficulty accessing public data, limited resources for Spanish-speakers, and an inability to reach broader audiences. Despite this, their study concluded that these organizations have been able to make a positive contribution to spreading accurate information and debunking disinformation through the use of digital tools, including social media.</p>

            <p>The lack of access to information for Latinos, whose often preferred language is Spanish, and the fast-paced nature of information dissipation on social media leads to the creation and spread of disinformation. To break this cycle, fact-checking that is accessible and conducted by those who understand the community is essential.</p>

            <h3>Where is the work taking place?</h3>
            <p>Small organizations are working across Latin America, the United States, and Spain to combat misinformation and disinformation across social media. These are just a few examples doing the fact-checking work:</p>

        <p>Verifying erroneous information is a daily challenge because something new appears every day that seeks to confuse people or institutions that seek their benefit by spreading falsehoods. However, we, as fact-checkers, seek to be transparent with the evidence that shows what is true and false, in an empathetic way so that our audience learns to differentiate when news comes from a false medium.</p>

        <p>What is missing now is fixing the difficulty of accessing public data, making resources more accessible to Spanish-speakers, and reaching broader audiences.</p>

        <p>Getting the audience involved in combating disinformation is the main key to combating the problem. They can do this by reading the verifications from any of the verification agencies that do their work in Spanish, such as <a href="https://www.univision.com/especiales/noticias/detector/">elDetector</a> (USA), <a href="https://maldita.es/">Maldita.es</a> (Spain), <a href="https://chequeado.com/">Chequeado</a> (Argentina), and more. Also, they can make sure not to share links that carry the disinformation they find on social networks, or send it to these groups to verify if it is false.</p>
