            <p>Misinformation is shared in Spanish more easily on social networks than in other languages ​​for many reasons. For the past three months, we have joined an international fact-checking effort to combat disinformation shared in Spanish.</p>
    
            <p>In March, we <a href="https://medium.com/eldeadline/cual-es-la-diferencia-entre-misinformaci%C3%B3n-y-la-desinformaci%C3%B3n-37149643006f">explained</a> the difference between social media misinformation and disinformation, and how you can check whether your information is correct or false. We then share the stories of three Latinos, <a href="https://medium.com/eldeadline/peleando-contra-la-desinformaci%C3%B3n-de-la-vacuna-del-covid-19-ba028111683e">John Rodríguez</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/eldeadline/verificador-de-datos-combina-datos-y-el-alcance-comunitario-para-combatir-la-desinformaci%C3%B3n-fef193448334">Jaime Longoria Castillo</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/eldeadline/grace-battaglia-y-el-trabajo-que-nunca-se-imagino-75aed6b29b3c">Grace Battaglia</a>, who fight disinformation through their work.</p>
    
            <p>The funds impacted more than five million people working in the cultural sectors of the US economy. "We... know that the arts provide comfort, resilience, wisdom, and the means for self-expression and connection, perhaps even more so in difficult times like these," the agency said in a press release.

                    <h3>1. BLOCKS (Stamps)</h3>
                    <p>The printmaking process begins by carving blocks or stamps out of sheets of plywood. Mr. Nutini uses a CNC router to create these blocks efficiently ahead of time and has developed a library of blocks that he uses throughout his print projects. </p>

                    <h3>2. INKING</h3>
                    <p>Once the blocks are selected to be included into a composition, they are moved to the inking area. Here they get an even layer of an oil based ink applied with a roller or brayer. The colors are carefully selected ahead of time and layered in a way that will make sense in the final composition. </p>

                <div class="inner">
                    <h3>3. PRESS</h3>
                    <p>After the block gets inked they are placed on the bed of the relief press. These presses have been in use for centuries, and the technology has not changed very much over the decades. Master printers have used these presses to print etchings, woodcuts, colographs, and other types of prints.</p>
                    <p>At the press, a sheet of paper gets placed on top of the plate and is run under a cylinder that applies even pressure as the plate passes through the press. This process gets repeated each time a new color is applied. Sometimes prints have over 10 to 15 layers of color once they are completed. </p>

                    <h3>4. DRYING</h3>
                    <p>The prints get placed in the drying rack after they have been run through the press. Depending on the density of the color it takes several days for the ink to dry because the ink used in the process is oil based and it takes several days for the binder in the ink to oxidize. This is where they completely dry at the end of the printing process. </p>

                        <h3>5. STAGING WALL</h3>
                        <p>Here is where the dried prints that are awaiting further colors are staged, or where the final pieces are inspected. This space is very important because it allows the master printer to review and compare different variations of the prints to control for quality and consistency.</p>

                        <p>During the final inspection, the prints are curated for quality and consistency. Prints that were damaged during the printing process are taken out of the final edition. At this stage the total number of prints in the edition is determined. The prints are individually numbered, titled, and signed by the artist.</p>
